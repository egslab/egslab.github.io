  I'm an Assistant Professor at the School of Medicine and Institute of Statistics in National Tsing Hua University from September 2023.  I came from a MD background and later received training in biostatistics.  
  My interest lies in extraction and synthesis of evidence from biomedical studies, in particular meta-analysis spectrum methods and causal inference in high-dimensional data.
