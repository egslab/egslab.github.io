  title     = "Graphical evaluation of evidence structure within a component
               network meta-analysis",
  author    = "Li, Hua and Shih, Ming-Chieh and Tu, Yu-Kang",
  abstract  = "Component network meta-analysis (CNMA) compares treatments
               comprising multiple components and estimates the effects of
               individual components. For network meta-analysis, a standard
               network plot with nodes for treatments and edges for direct
               comparisons between treatments is drawn to visualize the
               evidence structure and the connections between treatments.
               However, the standard network plot does not effectively
               illustrate the connections between components for a CNMA. For
               example, the comparison between linear combinations of
               components within a trial is not shown directly in a standard
               network plot, and whether all components are identifiable cannot
               be deduced directly from the plot. Therefore, we need a new
               approach to visualizing the evidence structure of a CNMA. In
               this article, we proposed a new graph, a modified signal-flow
               graph representing a system of equations, to evaluate the
               evidence structure for CNMA. In our new graph, each node
               represents a component, and arrows are used to show linear
               relationships between components. We used two examples to
               demonstrate how to draw and interpret the graph and how to use
               it to identify components that require more evidence.",

@ARTICLE{Li2022-qa,
  title     = "Bias propagation in network meta-analysis models",
  author    = "Li, Hua and Shih, Ming-Chieh and Song, Cheng-Jie and Tu, Yu-Kang",
  abstract  = "Network meta-analysis combines direct and indirect evidence to
               compare multiple treatments. As direct evidence for one
               treatment contrast may be indirect evidence for other treatment
               contrasts, biases in the direct evidence for one treatment
               contrast may affect not only the estimate for this particular
               treatment contrast but also estimates of other treatment
               contrasts. Because network structure determines how direct and
               indirect evidence are combined and weighted, the impact of
               biased evidence will be determined by the network geometry.
               Thus, this study's aim was to investigate how the impact of
               biased evidence spreads across the whole network and how the
               propagation of bias is influenced by the network structure. In
               addition to the popular Lu \& Ades model, we also investigate
               bias propagation in the baseline model and arm-based model to
               compare the effects of bias in the different models. We
               undertook extensive simulations under different scenarios to
               explore how the impact of bias may be affected by the location
               of the bias, network geometry and the statistical model. Our
               results showed that the structure of a network has an important
               impact on how the bias spreads across the network, and this is
               especially true for the Lu \& Ades model. The impact of bias is
               more likely to be diluted by other unbiased evidence in a
               well-connected network. We also used a real network
               meta-analysis to demonstrate how to use the new knowledge about
               bias propagation to explain questionable results from the
               original analysis.",

@ARTICLE{Shih2021-xv,
  title     = "An evidence-splitting approach to evaluation of direct-indirect
               evidence inconsistency in network meta-analysis",
  author    = "Shih, Ming-Chieh and Tu, Yu-Kang",
  abstract  = "Network meta-analysis (NMA) compares the efficacy and harm
               between several treatments by combining direct and indirect
               evidence. The validity of NMA requires that all available
               evidence form a coherent network. Failure to meet such
               requirement is known as inconsistency. The most popular approach
               to inconsistency detection is to compare the direct and indirect
               evidence for each treatment contrast. Although several models
               have been proposed to evaluate direct-indirect evidence
               inconsistency, there is no comprehensive study on the
               implications of how these models separate direct from indirect
               evidence. The main objective of this study is to show that
               evidence is not properly split into direct and indirect evidence
               in current inconsistency models, and to propose a novel approach
               to inconsistency evaluation based on the principle of
               independence between direct and indirect evidence. We further
               demonstrated that current models for direct-indirect evidence
               inconsistency can potentially lead to misleading conclusions in
               inconsistency detection and NMA quality appraisal, while our
               proposed evidence-splitting model satisfies the principle of
               independence when splitting the direct from indirect evidence in
               multi-arm trials. Moreover, we showed that all these
               direct-indirect evidence inconsistency models differ in how the
               weight of the inconsistency parameter is split between the
               treatments of interest, yet only the evidence-splitting model
               assigns satisfying weights. Finally, we demonstrated how the
               evidence-splitting model can be implemented within the
               structural equation modeling framework. The evidence-splitting
               model may be a valuable tool to assess the inconsistency within
               NMA and evaluate the quality of its evidence.",

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
