Welcome to the website for the Evidence Generation & Synthesis Lab (egsLab)! Based at National Tsing Hua Univeristy in Taiwan, we are interested in developing and employing methods for the following goals, on both small-scaled and high-dimensional data:

- Evidence **Generation**: How biomedical data should be analyzed to produce evidence that provides us insight in future clinical decisions. In particular, we are looking into _causal inference_ methods that address and alleviate bias arising in evidence generation.
- Evidence **Synthesis**: How evidence from multiple sources can be robustly combined to aquire the best-available evidence for our topic of interest. This involves meta-analysis spetrum methods and other data fusion approaches.

Talk to us or join our group if you are interested in (or just want to known more about) these topics or our work!
