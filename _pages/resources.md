### Shiny apps for research

- [**Lung-boneMets Tool**](https://app.mcshih.com/lung_boneMets)
    - Companion online app for [*Yap WK, Shih MC, Kuo C, et al. Development and Validation of a Nomogram for Assessing Survival in Patients With Metastatic Lung Cancer Referred for Radiotherapy for Bone Metastases. JAMA Network Open. 2018;1(6):e183242. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.3242*](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2706494)
    - Provides survival prediction for metastatic lung cancer patients referred for radiotherapy for bone metastases

### Shiny apps for teaching in biostatics

- [**Effect measures for binary outcomes**](https://app.mcshih.com/or_rr): 
    - Demonstration of the relationship between odds ratio, risk ratio, risk difference and number needed to treat / harm under different baseline risks

- [**Sampling distribution and central limit theorem**](https://app.mcshih.com/sampling_clt): 
    - Demonstration of the sampling distribution of sample mean, variance and standard deviation under different population distributions 
    - Shows central limit theorem at work, and how population distribution affects speed of convergence.
